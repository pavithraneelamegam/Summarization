# **INTRODUCTION**
This repository contains the implementation, trained models, and experimental scripts for abstractive summarization system developed for long-form legal case judgment summarization.
# **Finetuned BART – Legal Judgment Summarization Script**
This script provides a complete end-to-end pipeline for training, evaluating, and applying a fine-tuned BART model for abstractive summarization of legal case judgments. It includes comprehensive preprocessing, supervised model training using reference summaries, generation of test summaries, and an embedding-based faithfulness scoring module.
